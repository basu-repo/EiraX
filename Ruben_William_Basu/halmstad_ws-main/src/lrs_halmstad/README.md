## Recommended 1-to-1 bring-up

### 1. Start Gazebo + Husky

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
./run.sh gazebo_sim warehouse
```

### 2. Spawn one UAV

Use the GUI spawn plugin or the integrated-camera launch:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad spawn_uav_1to1.launch.py
```

### 3. Start the 1-to-1 UAV follow stack

This starts the UAV simulator adapter plus the follow stack for `dji0` and `a201_0000`.

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py
```

Useful overrides:

```bash
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py leader_mode:=odom
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py leader_mode:=estimate start_leader_estimator:=true
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py ugv_mode:=nav2
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py ugv_mode:=nav2 ugv_initial_pose_x:=1.0 ugv_initial_pose_y:=2.0 ugv_initial_pose_yaw_deg:=90.0
```

Important launch-default nuance:
- `run_follow.launch.py` still declares `leader_actual_pose_enable`, `publish_follow_debug_topics`, `publish_pose_cmd_topics`, and `publish_camera_debug_topics` with launch-default `true`
- `./run.sh 1to1_yolo ...` overrides those to a quieter runtime

For `ugv_mode:=nav2`, start Clearpath localization and Nav2 separately first. The follow launch will then drive the Husky through `/a201_0000/navigate_to_pose` using the configured waypoint route.

For file-based waypoint routes such as `config/warehouse_waypoints.yaml`, the Nav2 UGV driver now constrains the first selected waypoint to one that lies forward of the current UGV heading when possible, so the route does not start with an immediate backward segment. After that initial choice, the remaining file-waypoint order keeps the usual randomization behavior.

If you want to test Nav2 goals from a separate node, use `ugv_mode:=external` in the follow launch so it does not also start its own UGV driver.

The Nav2 UGV driver now also auto-publishes `/a201_0000/initialpose` before sending goals. The `ugv_initial_pose_*` values are in the saved map frame, not Gazebo world coordinates.

For `world:=orchard`, the launch defaults now auto-fill the current verified orchard map-frame initial pose, so you do not need to manually publish `/a201_0000/initialpose` for the normal Nav2 bring-up. The recommended orchard Nav2 map is `maps/orchard_nav.yaml`, which keeps black occupied cells and frees gray terrain/unknown cells from the raw SLAM map.

For `world:=baylands`, the launch defaults now auto-fill the current verified Baylands AMCL startup pose and packaged Baylands waypoint route (`config/baylands_waypoints.yaml`). Baylands follow defaults also switch the UAV leader source to `/<ugv>/ground_truth/odom`, which is bridged directly from the Gazebo world pose so the UAV and UGV stay in the same coordinate frame. The actively supported Baylands Nav2 maps are `maps/baylands.yaml` (the current default in `./run.sh localization baylands`) and `maps/baylands_merged.yaml` (pose-compatible test variant). Other Baylands map files in `maps/` should be treated as experimental and are not part of the normal bring-up path.

Current Baylands follow shortcuts:

```bash
cd /home/ruben/halmstad_ws
./run.sh tmux_1to1 baylands
./run.sh tmux_1to1 baylands waypoint:=parkinglot_east_0 mode:=follow \
  nav2_goals:=parkinglot_east
```

Direct Baylands stack:

```bash
cd /home/ruben/halmstad_ws
./run.sh gazebo_sim baylands true waypoint:=parkinglot_east_0
./run.sh spawn_uav baylands
./run.sh localization baylands lidar:=3d
./run.sh nav2 lidar:=3d
./run.sh 1to1_follow baylands \
  nav2_goals:=parkinglot_east
```

## Baylands Nav2 map maintenance

The active Baylands Nav2 maps are:
- `maps/baylands_finished_v3_nav_20cm.yaml`
- `maps/baylands_finished_v3_nav_20cm_merged.yaml`

Both are intended to stay pose-compatible. Keep these values unchanged unless you are intentionally rebuilding the Baylands map frame:
- `resolution: 0.200`
- `origin: [-227, -444.5, 0.0]`
- `mode: trinary`
- `occupied_thresh: 0.65`
- `free_thresh: 0.196`

Current Baylands map workflow:
- Start from the pose-compatible Baylands base map, not a fresh arbitrary export.
- Edit the PGM in GIMP at the same canvas size so the map frame stays aligned with the saved AMCL poses and Baylands waypoint files.
- Keep the image trinary: white for free road, black for blocked/occupied areas, and gray for unknown or "do not rely on this" terrain.
- Add black where the UGV should not drive, especially on narrow, bumpy, or misleading side paths.
- Export the final image as a full-resolution PGM and keep the YAML metadata matched to the same pose-compatible base.
- Test in RViz with localization running and compare the Baylands map against AMCL plus the live scan overlay before changing defaults in scripts.

## Baylands waypoint authoring

Useful Baylands waypoint sources:
- `maps/waypoints_baylands.csv` for the flat list.
- `maps/waypoints_baylands_groups.csv` for grouped Baylands areas used by `waypoint:=...` and grouped route launches.
- `config/baylands_waypoints/` for Nav2-ready YAML routes such as `baylands_waypoints_strip.yaml` and `baylands_waypoints_parkinglot_east.yaml`.

Helpful scripts:
- `./run.sh save_waypoint_csv <name> output:=waypoints_baylands_groups.csv group:=strip`
- `./run.sh save_waypoint_yaml <name> output:=src/lrs_halmstad/config/baylands_waypoints/baylands_waypoints_strip.yaml group:=strip`

These helpers read the current Gazebo pose plus the current AMCL pose, then save them in the formats used by the Baylands spawn and Nav2 pipelines.

For standalone Nav2 testing without RViz goals:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad ugv_nav2_goal_tester --ros-args \
  -r __ns:=/a201_0000 \
  -p pattern:=square \
  -p pattern_size_m:=2.0
```

This waits for `/a201_0000/amcl_pose`, then sends a simple square of `NavigateToPose` goals and publishes the planned test path on `/a201_0000/test_goal_path`.

### 4. View the UAV camera

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
./run.sh rqt_image_view /dji0/camera0/image_raw
```

## Manual smoke test path

Use this when testing the legacy UAV control topics directly.

### Spawn only the UAV

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lrs_halmstad spawn_uav_1to1.launch.py
```

### Start the Gazebo adapter

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad simulator --ros-args -p uav_name:=dji0 -p camera_mode:=integrated_joint
```

### Publish manual test motion

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad controller --ros-args -p uav_name:=dji0
```

## Notes

- `follow_uav` no longer talks to Gazebo directly. It publishes to `/dji0/psdk_ros2/flight_control_setpoint_ENUposition_yaw` and leaves Gazebo actuation to `simulator`.
- In simulation, `simulator` interprets `/dji0/psdk_ros2/flight_control_setpoint_ENUposition_yaw` as an absolute ENU pose setpoint: `x`, `y`, `z`, `yaw`.
- The attached gimbal path is now the default camera backend in Gazebo, while the ROS image topics remain `/dji0/camera0/*`.
- Attached-camera teleport spawns now use a non-static UAV model with a kinematic `base_link`, so the gimbal joints visibly actuate while the body remains pose-driven by `simulator`.
- `uav_simulator` boots **relaxed**: no gimbal joint commands are published until the first `update_pan` or `update_tilt` message arrives. The joint rests at its SDF-default until the follow stack or a manual command arms it. Motion is then rate-limited at `pan_rate_deg_s: 45.0` and `tilt_rate_deg_s: 60.0`, configurable in `config/run_follow_defaults.yaml` under the `uav_simulator` section (uses `yaml_param`, so the values **must** be present in the YAML â€” there is no hardcoded fallback). Pan was reduced from 90 Â°/s to 45 Â°/s to prevent large visible jumps during UAV yaw changes.
- Camera image bridge (`/image`, `/camera_info`, `/depth_image`) is now Gazeboâ†’ROS only, reducing stale-frame buffering in image viewers.
- `camera_update_rate` spawn arg is now correctly wired through to the SDF (was declared but not passed to xacro). The spawn default is `10` Hz, which is the recommended value for WSL2 â€” Ogre2 rendering through WSLg is the primary RTF bottleneck. Increase only if your host can sustain RTF â‰¥ 1.0 at higher rates.
- `leader_estimator` now defaults to the actual simulated UAV pose topic `/dji0/pose`, not `/dji0/pose_cmd`.
- The active perception range mode is `auto` (depth â†’ radio â†’ const). Available explicit modes: `depth`, `radio`, `const`. Set via `range_mode` in `run_follow_defaults.yaml` under `leader_estimator`. The `ground` mode has been removed.
- When running with OMNeT++, `leader_estimator` subscribes to `/omnet/radio_distance` and uses it as the middle tier in `auto` mode (between depth and constant-range fallback). The raw FSPL-inverted Euclidean range is projected to horizontal distance using the current UAV altitude. Configure via `radio_range_topic` and `radio_range_timeout_s`. Set `radio_range_topic: ''` to disable entirely.
- Depth range sampling uses the **inner 50 % of the detection bounding box** (25 % margin on each edge) instead of a fixed 5 Ã— 5 pixel patch. This scales correctly at all distances and avoids edge pixels that land on background or drone body. Requires at least 10 valid pixels (`depth_patch_min_valid_px`).
- YOLO `conf_threshold` is 0.15 for both `leader_detector` and `leader_tracker`. Lowered from 0.3 to improve detection recall with the newer OBB models; `min_confidence_threshold` (absolute floor in `leader_estimator`) is 0.08.
- YOLO inference now defaults to `device: 'auto'`. On CUDA-capable hosts (for example HH GPU-LAB) the detector/tracker will use GPU 0 automatically; on non-CUDA hosts such as the current WSL2 AMD setup they fall back to CPU. Expected CPU detection rate is still roughly 3â€“10 Hz depending on image resolution and model size.
- The live detector/tracker runtime now defaults to asynchronous newest-frame-only processing. `leader_detector` and `leader_tracker` keep only one pending image, use `image_qos_depth: 1`, stamp every published detection with timing metadata, and can write per-frame benchmark CSV rows via `benchmark_csv_path`.
- Runtime backend selection is controlled by `detector_backend:=ultralytics|onnx_cpu|onnx_directml` plus optional `detector_onnx_model:=<path>`. On Windows + AMD, install `onnxruntime-directml` in the runtime environment before using `detector_backend:=onnx_directml`.
- Export the current trained Ultralytics model to ONNX with `ros2 run lrs_halmstad export_yolo_onnx --weights <model.pt> --out <model.onnx> --imgsz 640`. The command also writes a `.manifest.json` next to the exported ONNX file for reproducible deployment.
- Compare baseline vs improved runtime with launch overrides, for example:
  - baseline sync Ultralytics: `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py detector_backend:=ultralytics detector_async_inference:=false detector_benchmark_csv_path:=/tmp/baseline.csv`
  - async Ultralytics: `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py detector_backend:=ultralytics detector_async_inference:=true detector_benchmark_csv_path:=/tmp/async.csv`
  - async ONNX CPU: `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py detector_backend:=onnx_cpu detector_onnx_model:=/abs/model.onnx detector_benchmark_csv_path:=/tmp/onnx_cpu.csv`
  - async ONNX DirectML: `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py detector_backend:=onnx_directml detector_onnx_model:=C:/path/model.onnx detector_benchmark_csv_path:=C:/temp/onnx_dml.csv`
- Summarize benchmark CSVs with `ros2 run lrs_halmstad run_perception_benchmark_summary /tmp/baseline.csv /tmp/async.csv /tmp/onnx_cpu.csv`.
- Image center correction (`image_center_correction_enable`) is **enabled** at `tick_hz: 10.0` (matched to the CPU YOLO detection rate). Running the tracker faster than the detection rate caused corrections to flicker on stale bounding boxes, producing gimbal jitter that disrupted ByteTrack. Keep `tick_hz` â‰¤ the expected YOLO rate, or disable correction if running at a higher tick rate without GPU inference.
- All world SDF files use consistent physics parameters: `max_step_size: 0.004`, `real_time_update_rate: 250` (targeting RTF â‰¤ 1.0).
- The Husky now uses `lidar2d_0` as its only active range sensor in this workspace. The old temporary `lidar3d_0` path is no longer part of the active bring-up.
- UGV mobility now runs in two supported modes: `ugv_mode:=nav2` sends sequential Nav2 `NavigateToPose` goals derived from the configured route, and `ugv_mode:=external` leaves UGV motion to an external Nav2 goal source.

### Reverting the current attached-gimbal kinematic workaround

If you need to back out the current visible-gimbal fix, revert these files together:

- `src/lrs_halmstad/launch/spawn_robot.launch.py`
  - restore teleport spawns to `model_static:=true`
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic_for_mode` wiring
- `src/lrs_halmstad/lrs_halmstad/generate_sdf.py`
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic` parameter and mapping
- `src/lrs_halmstad/xacro/lrs_model.xacro`
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic` arg and passthrough into `lrs_m100_macro`
- `src/lrs_halmstad/xacro/lrs_m100_base.sdf.xacro`
  - remove `<kinematic>${base_link_kinematic}</kinematic>`
  - if you want the exact old behavior, also remove `<gravity>false</gravity>` from `base_link`

Expected rollback result:
- the old static-body teleport behavior returns
- attached gimbal joints may stop producing visible camera motion in Gazebo again

## Gimbal control

`follow_control` commands the simulator gimbal directly. It publishes
`std_msgs/Float64` degrees to:

- `/{uav_name}/update_pan`
- `/{uav_name}/update_tilt`

This path does not depend on `camera_tracker` override topics.

### follow_control keyboard mode

```bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad run_follow_control keyboard --uav-name dji0
```

Keys:

- `w/s`: increase/decrease `d_target`
- `a/d`: decrease/increase `leader_heading_offset_deg`
- `j/l`: pan left/right
- `i/k`: tilt up/down
- `c`: center gimbal
- `p`: print current values
- `q`: quit

### follow_control gimbal sweep (random dataset collection)

`follow_control` in `random` mode can simultaneously sweep the gimbal alongside
follow distance randomisation:

```bash
# Sweep d_target and gimbal together
ros2 run lrs_halmstad run_follow_control random --gimbal --uav-name dji0

# Only sweep gimbal (skip d_target param changes)
ros2 run lrs_halmstad run_follow_control random --gimbal-only --uav-name dji0

# Custom sweep ranges and cadence
ros2 run lrs_halmstad run_follow_control random --gimbal \
  --tilt-center -45 --tilt-amplitude 20 --tilt-min -75 --tilt-max -15 \
  --pan-center 0   --pan-amplitude 25  --pan-min -45 --pan-max 45 \
  --gimbal-interval 8 --interval 10 --uav-name dji0
```

Relevant `follow_control random` gimbal args:

| Arg | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--gimbal` | off | Also sweep pan/tilt alongside d_target |
| `--gimbal-only` | off | Only sweep pan/tilt; skip d_target |
| `--gimbal-interval` | `--interval` | Seconds between gimbal updates |
| `--tilt-center` | -45Â° | Centre of the tilt random distribution |
| `--tilt-amplitude` | 15Â° | Â±amplitude around centre |
| `--tilt-min` / `--tilt-max` | -75Â° / -15Â° | Hard limits |
| `--pan-center` | 0Â° | Centre of the pan random distribution |
| `--pan-amplitude` | 20Â° | Â±amplitude around centre |
| `--pan-min` / `--pan-max` | -45Â° / 45Â° | Hard limits |
| `--uav-name` | `dji0` | UAV namespace for update topics |

Set `gimbal_override_hold_s` in `run_follow_defaults.yaml` to a value slightly larger than `--gimbal-interval` (e.g. `10.0` with `--gimbal-interval 8`).

## Dataset tools

All dataset tools resolve paths relative to `~/halmstad_ws/datasets/` unless an absolute path is given.

### make_obb â€” generate OBB labels

```bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad make_obb warehouse_v3
ros2 run lrs_halmstad make_obb warehouse_v3 --overlay          # also write overlay_obb/ images
ros2 run lrs_halmstad make_obb warehouse_v3 --overlay --overwrite  # regenerate all
```

- Reads `metadata/<split>/<stem>.json` for `projected_points` and camera intrinsics.
- Writes Ultralytics 8-point OBB labels to `labels/<split>/`.
- `--overlay`: draws yellow projected-point dots + green OBB polygon on each image into `overlay_obb/<split>/`.
- `--overwrite`: regenerates existing label/overlay files instead of skipping them.

### prune_negatives â€” delete frames where the UGV is not visible

Labels are generated geometrically (without occlusion checking), so some frames have valid-looking labels but the UGV is actually behind a wall or out of frame. Use this tool to prune them:

```bash
# Dry run â€” shows what would be deleted
ros2 run lrs_halmstad prune_negatives warehouse_v3 --dry-run

# Actually delete (removes matching files from images/, labels/, labels_det/, metadata/, overlays/)
ros2 run lrs_halmstad prune_negatives warehouse_v3

# Stricter threshold (default 8)
ros2 run lrs_halmstad prune_negatives warehouse_v3 --min-visible-points 12
```

A frame is pruned when:
1. The label file is empty, **or**
2. Fewer than `--min-visible-points` (default `8`) of the 33 projected cuboid corners fall within the image bounds.

Files are deleted from all sibling directories with the same stem (`images/`, `labels/`, `labels_det/`, `metadata/`, `overlay/`, `overlay_detection/`, `overlay_obb/`).

### Zipping for Ultralytics upload

```bash
cd ~/halmstad_ws/datasets/warehouse_v3
zip -r ~/warehouse_v3_obb.zip images/ labels/ dataset.yaml
```

Ensure `dataset.yaml` has `path: .` (not an absolute path) so Ultralytics can resolve it after upload.

## Contract checks

Base Gazebo + AMCL-derived UGV pose + UAV camera contract:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run lrs_halmstad contract_check orchard dji0
```

Include the UAV simulator topics:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
REQUIRE_UAV_ADAPTER=1 ros2 run lrs_halmstad contract_check orchard dji0
```

Include the odom-follow outputs as well:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
REQUIRE_UAV_ADAPTER=1 REQUIRE_FOLLOW_STACK=1 ros2 run lrs_halmstad contract_check orchard dji0
```

Include detector plus estimator topics when running the YOLO estimate path:

```bash
cd <workspace_root>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
REQUIRE_UAV_ADAPTER=1 REQUIRE_FOLLOW_STACK=1 REQUIRE_DETECTION=1 REQUIRE_ESTIMATOR=1 ros2 run lrs_halmstad contract_check orchard dji0
```

Useful overrides:

- `UGV_NAMESPACE=<name>` changes the default UGV namespace from `a201_0000`
- `REQUIRED_FLOW_TOPICS=<csv>` overrides the default flow check topic list
- `UGV_CMD_TOPICS=<csv>` overrides the cmd-vel subscriber check topics

Current defaults:

- base UGV odom flow check uses `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom` (Baylands follow defaults use `/<ugv>/ground_truth/odom`)
- follow-stack checks no longer require `/<uav>/pose_cmd/odom`
- detector and estimator are checked separately with `REQUIRE_DETECTION=1` and `REQUIRE_ESTIMATOR=1`
