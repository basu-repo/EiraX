# Running Sim

Default tested path: `warehouse`.

Assumption:

- you already start in the workspace root
- wrapper files now live under `scripts/`
- use `./run.sh <name>` and `./stop.sh <name>` from the workspace root
- optional bash startup hook for completion:
  - `source "$HOME/halmstad_ws/scripts/bashrc_halmstad_ws.bash"`
- quiet YOLO defaults in this file refer to `./run.sh 1to1_yolo ...`
- a bare `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py ...` still inherits the launch-argument defaults unless you override them explicitly

Recommended tmux workflow:

- start with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse`
- for an on-screen Gazebo test, use `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true`
- start YOLO mode with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo`
- start YOLO tracker mode with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo tracker:=true`
- record a YOLO run with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true`
- record a YOLO vision run with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true record_profile:=vision`
- speed up sim time with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse rtf:=2.0`
- pass a custom YOLO weight with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo weights:=yolo26v2.pt`
- enable truth-assisted YOLO testing with `./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo use_estimate:=false`
- stop with `./stop.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse`
- default tmux layout is panes:
  - row 1: `gazebo | spawn`
  - row 2: `localization | nav2`
  - row 3: `follow`
- current default delays:
  - `gui:=false` -> `spawn=8`, `localization/nav2=10`, `follow=12`
  - `gui:=true` -> `spawn=6`, `localization/nav2=8`, `follow=10`
- in tmux mode, the follow pane now starts after its staged delay without an extra Nav2-localization wait gate
- Nav2 readiness is now enforced inside `ugv_nav2_driver`, which avoids circular startup waits during AMCL initial-pose seeding
- `ugv_nav2_driver` now also waits for those required Nav2 lifecycle nodes before its first goal send and before retrying a rejected goal, so the UGV side stays guarded even if launch timing changes
- on WSL, `./run.sh gazebo_sim ... true` now defaults to software GL rendering for GUI stability unless you override it
- `camera_tracker` now uses an odom-frame UGV pose for camera-only reacquisition by default, which helps detached-camera YOLO runs recover from bad startup framing without mixing `map` and `odom` frames while keeping UAV motion ownership on the visual pipeline

## Start 1-to-1 Sim With Nav2 And AMCL Follow

Run these in order in separate terminals:

1. Start Gazebo:

```bash
./run.sh gazebo_sim warehouse
```

Without GUI:

```bash
./run.sh gazebo_sim warehouse false
```

2. Spawn one UAV:

```bash
./run.sh spawn_uav warehouse uav_name:=dji0
```

3. Start localization:

```bash
./run.sh localization warehouse
```

If you want a different saved map:

```bash
./run.sh localization warehouse maps/warehouse_manual.yaml
```

4. Start Nav2:

```bash
./run.sh nav2
```

5. Start the AMCL-based odom follow stack:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_follow warehouse
```

#### If you want the same stack started automatically in tmux, use:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse
```

Recommended visible test run:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true
```

YOLO variant in tmux:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo
```

Default tmux layout is panes:

- Gazebo
- UAV spawn
- localization
- Nav2
- follow

Useful overrides:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=false
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse delay_s:=9
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse spawn_delay_s:=12 follow_delay_s:=18
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse layout:=windows
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo use_actual_heading:=false
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo follow_yaw:=false use_tilt:=false
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true record_profile:=vision
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse rtf:=2.0
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse tmux_attach:=false
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse dry_run:=true
```

Default startup is staggered with short delays so the later launches do not all fire at the same instant.

Default delays depend on `gui:=true|false`:

- `gui:=false` uses `spawn=8`, `localization/nav2=10`, and `follow=12`
- `gui:=true` uses `spawn=6`, `localization/nav2=8`, and `follow=10`

If your machine is slower, increase the delay args:

- `delay_s:=...`
- `spawn_delay_s:=...`
- `localization_delay_s:=...`
- `nav2_delay_s:=...`
- `follow_delay_s:=...`

If you want separate tmux windows instead of the default panes:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse layout:=windows
```

Alias:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse panes:=true
```

Pane layout is:

- row 1: Gazebo | spawn
- row 2: localization | Nav2
- row 3: follow

To stop the tmux-managed stack cleanly, use:

```bash
./stop.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse
```

This sends `Ctrl-c` in this order:

- follow, localization, and Nav2 together
- wait `5s`
- Gazebo
- spawn is expected to exit automatically when Gazebo goes down

Then it waits a few seconds, kills the tmux session, performs a safety cleanup pass for leftover Gazebo, launch, and child stack node processes, and clears stale helper state files under `/tmp/halmstad_ws`.
If recording was enabled, the stop flow also stops the recorder pane and cleans up matching `ros2 bag record` processes as fallback.

Useful stop overrides:

```bash
./stop.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse group_grace_s:=2
./stop.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse final_grace_s:=8
./stop.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse kill_session:=false
./stop.sh tmux_1to1 session:=halmstad-warehouse-1to1
```

Current baseline:

- this odom-follow path now uses `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom`, not raw `/platform/odom`
- `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom` is synthesized from `/<ugv>/amcl_pose` by [pose_cov_to_odom.py](src/lrs_halmstad/lrs_halmstad/sim/pose_cov_to_odom.py)
- when the Clearpath sim odom / TF path is late during startup, the active follow launch also synthesizes `/<ugv>/platform/odom`, `/<ugv>/platform/odom/filtered`, and fallback `odom -> base_link` TF from `/<ugv>/amcl_pose`
- launch `leader_odom_topic` / `ugv_odom_topic` defaults are intentionally pointed at that AMCL-derived topic
- current UAV camera mode is attached/integrated: `uav_camera_mode:=integrated_joint`
- attached-camera teleport spawns now use a non-static UAV model with a kinematic base link so the gimbal joints visibly actuate while the body still follows the simulator `set_pose` path
- spawned UAV camera is now RGBD-capable while keeping the existing RGB ROS topics
- additional UAV depth topic is available at `/<uav>/camera0/depth_image`
- current camera defaults are `pan_enable: true` and `tilt_enable: true`
- current XY body-command mode is `uav_xy_command_mode:=controller_step` with `uav_xy_command_step_scale:=0.6`
- detached camera mode has been removed from simulation
- gimbal boots relaxed: no joint commands are sent until the follow stack (or a manual command) sends the first `update_pan` / `update_tilt`; motion is rate-limited at 90 °/s pan, 60 °/s tilt
- camera image bridge is Gazebo→ROS only; set `camera_update_rate:=10` at spawn time if RTF is low (e.g. WSL2)
- if you override the mount pitch for attached mode, pass the same value to follow:

```bash
./run.sh spawn_uav warehouse uav_name:=dji0 camera:=attached mount_pitch_deg:=35
./run.sh 1to1_follow warehouse camera:=attached mount_pitch_deg:=35
```

Important:
- pass the same mount pitch to both spawn and follow when overriding it
- the wrapper alias also accepts `camera:=attached`

Rollback of the current attached-gimbal kinematic workaround:
- revert `src/lrs_halmstad/launch/spawn_robot.launch.py`
  - restore teleport spawns to the old `model_static:=true` behavior
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic_for_mode` path
- revert `src/lrs_halmstad/lrs_halmstad/generate_sdf.py`
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic` parameter and mapping
- revert `src/lrs_halmstad/xacro/lrs_model.xacro`
  - remove the `base_link_kinematic` xacro arg and passthrough
- revert `src/lrs_halmstad/xacro/lrs_m100_base.sdf.xacro`
  - remove `<kinematic>${base_link_kinematic}</kinematic>`
  - if you want the exact pre-workaround behavior, also remove `<gravity>false</gravity>` from `base_link`

Expected rollback result:
- UAV body teleport mode returns to the older static-model behavior
- visible attached-gimbal motion in Gazebo may disappear again

Important runtime note:

- Gazebo sim time is guarded through [clock_guard.py](src/lrs_halmstad/lrs_halmstad/sim/clock_guard.py)
- expected `/clock` publisher is `clock_guard`
- if Gazebo is restarted or the world is reset, restart localization, Nav2, and follow

## Start The Camera Views

Saved multi-camera / debug layout:

```bash
./run.sh rqt_perspective
```

Then under `Perspectives`, choose one from the `perspectives/` folder if needed.

UAV camera: `/dji0/camera0/image_raw`

UAV depth image: ``/dji0/camera0/depth_image``

UGV camera: ``/a201_0000/sensors/camera_0/color/image``

YOLO debug image: `/coord/leader_debug_image`

Overlay fields:
- left block:
  - `est: (...)`
  - `actual: (...)`
  - `est_d: ...`
  - `est_xy: ...`
  - `real_d: ...`
  - `real_xy: ...`
  - `real_z: ...`
  - `range_src: ...`
  - `bearing: ...`
  - `est_heading: forward|reverse|left|right`
  - `heading_src: ...`
- right block:
  - `task: detection|obb`
  - `state: ...`
  - `reason: ...`
  - `conf: ...`
  - `src: detector|tracker|none`
  - `id: ...`
  - `hits: ...`
  - `age: ...s`
- bottom-left:
  - `latency_ms: ...`

Only use the YOLO debug image when you started the YOLO flow from the section below.

## Control Height And Distance During Runtime

These work while `./run.sh 1to1_follow` or `./run.sh 1to1_yolo` is running.

Recommended live control:
- change `d_target` during runtime
- this updates the derived `xy_target` from the current `z_min`
- no restart is needed for this control
- the direct `ros2` commands below assume the terminal is already sourced

Change the 3D UAV-to-UGV follow distance:

```bash
ros2 param set /follow_uav d_target x.xx
```

Examples:

```bash
ros2 param set /follow_uav d_target 9.0
ros2 param set /follow_uav xy_min 5.0
ros2 param set /follow_uav z_min 9.0
```

Use `xy_min`, `xy_max`, `z_min`, and `z_max` if you want to constrain the working range around the shared `d_target`.

Runtime follow control helper:

The moved helper wrappers are available through `./run.sh <name>` and still
exist under `./scripts/run_<name>.sh` if you want direct file completion.

```bash
./run.sh follow_control
```

Default keyboard mode:
- this is the live tuning path for `d_target` and `z_min`
- `w` raises `z_min`
- `s` lowers `z_min`
- `d` increases `d_target`
- `a` decreases `d_target`
- `r` refreshes the current values
- `h` shows the help text
- `q` quits

Random sweep mode:

- pass `--mode random`
- current defaults:
- updates every `10s`
- `z_min` sampled uniformly in `[2, 40]`
- `d_target` sampled uniformly in `[1, 20]`
- sampling is biased toward the `5-15` band by default
- runs until you stop it with `Ctrl-c`

Useful examples:

```bash
./run.sh follow_control
./run.sh follow_control --step-z-alt 2 --step-d-target 2
./run.sh follow_control --mode params --step-z-alt 2 --step-d-target 2
./run.sh follow_control --mode random --interval 8
./run.sh follow_control --mode random --count 20
./run.sh follow_control --mode random --seed 42
./run.sh follow_control --mode random --interval 8 --count 20 --seed 42
./run.sh follow_control --mode random --focus-weight 0.8
```

## Reset A Running Experiment

To reset the UAV and restart the follow stack without stopping Gazebo or Nav2:

```bash
./run.sh reset_experiment warehouse
```

What it does:

1. Sends Ctrl-C to the follow (and record) pane
2. Kills all follow-related ROS nodes (`camera_tracker`, `leader_estimator`, `uav_simulator`, etc.) — does **not** touch Gazebo, Nav2, localization, or the spawn pane
3. Teleports the UAV back to its spawn position via `ros2 service call /world/<world>/set_pose`
4. Re-sends the original follow command to the follow pane
5. If recording was active, restarts the recorder after a 3 s delay

Optionally reset the UGV too (teleports back to spawn position and lets `ugv_nav2_driver` re-publish `/initialpose` on follow restart):

```bash
./run.sh reset_experiment warehouse reset_ugv:=true
```

Requires that the session was started with `./run.sh tmux_1to1` so pane IDs and the follow command are saved in the state file.

Preview without executing:

```bash
./run.sh reset_experiment warehouse dry_run:=true
```

UGV entity name in Gazebo is `<ugv_namespace>/robot` (e.g. `a201_0000/robot`). UAV entity name is the UAV name directly (e.g. `dji0`).

## Record A Run

Recommended recorder path through tmux:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true
```

Add image topics too:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true record_profile:=vision
```

Small Step 2/3 proof bag:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse mode:=yolo record:=true record_profile:=step2_light
```

Recommended Step 2 proof run:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=false weights:=warehouse_v1-v2-yolo26n.pt use_estimate:=false start_visual_follow_controller:=true record:=true record_profile:=vision delay_s:=12
```

Recommended planner-enabled bridge run:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true record:=true record_profile:=step2_light record_tag:=planner_phase delay_s:=12
```

Use this stable bridge mode first when validating planner behavior:

- `use_estimate:=false` keeps the planner + bridge audit focused on the filter/estimator/follow-point/planner/bridge path instead of mixing in extra estimate-driven camera instability too early
- current tuned defaults reduce area-mode forward aggressiveness, allow smaller yaw corrections to reach the body, and decay commands faster on short loss / no-distance cases
- `leader_estimator` now uses live camera tilt/yaw topics when available:
  - `/<uav>/follow/actual/tilt_deg`
  - `/<uav>/camera/actual/world_yaw_rad`
- recent stable bridge proof runs meaningfully exercised projected range in this mode, so this remains the recommended projected-range validation command
- recent stable planner proof runs showed:
  - `follow_point_generator` active and publishing consistently
  - `follow_point_planner` active and publishing consistently
  - `visual_actuation_bridge` consuming `active_input=planned_target`
  - bounded motion through the planner-backed world-frame target

Direct recorder wrapper:

```bash
./run.sh record_experiment warehouse mode:=yolo profile:=vision
```

Bag monitor helper:

```bash
./run.sh bag_monitor const_test
./run.sh bag_monitor const_test /coord/leader_estimate_status /coord/leader_distance_debug
```

`bag_monitor` resolves relative bag paths under `bags/experiments/`. You can pass either the experiment run directory, its `bag/` subdirectory, or a short run token like `const_test` / `depth_test` and it will use the latest matching bag. If you pass no topics, it runs `ros2 bag info` and prints the recorded `topics.txt` list when available. If you do pass topics in an interactive terminal, it renders them as a live block dashboard instead of raw scrolling `ros2 topic echo` output. `leader_...` string topics are reformatted into fixed-width key/value columns, and `leader_distance_debug` uses a dedicated grouped layout with `range_src`, `range_m`, estimated distances, real distances, and signed distance deltas on separate rows.

Default recorder output:

- `bags/experiments/<world>/<timestamp>_<mode>/`

Recorder topic groups:

- default:
  - `/clock`
  - `/coord/events`
  - `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom`
  - `/<uav>/pose`
  - `/<uav>/pose_cmd`
  - `/<uav>/pose_cmd/odom`
  - `/<uav>/camera0/actual/center_pose`
  - `/<uav>/camera0/target/center_pose`
  - `/<uav>/follow/actual/anchor_pose`
  - `/<uav>/follow/target/anchor_pose`
- YOLO mode adds:
  - `/coord/leader_estimate`
  - `/coord/leader_distance_debug`
  - `/coord/leader_estimate_status`
  - `/coord/leader_estimate_error`
  - `/<uav>/follow/target/d_target_m`
  - `/<uav>/follow/target/xy_target_m`
  - `/<uav>/follow/actual/xy_distance_m`
  - `/<uav>/follow/actual/distance_3d_m`
  - `/<uav>/follow/error/xy_distance_m`
  - `/<uav>/follow/error/anchor_distance_m`
- `profile:=vision` also adds:
  - `/<uav>/camera0/image_raw`
  - `/<uav>/camera0/camera_info`

## Capture Images For Datasets

Do this while the follow stack is already running.

Default output:

- `datasets/warehouse_auto`

Recommended workflow:

1. start the sim
2. start the UAV and follow stack
3. start dataset capture
4. change `d_target` during runtime
5. let Nav2 drive the UGV through the route
6. once happy, switch world / map campaign and restart all terminals if needed

This gives:

- multiple camera heights / distances
- multiple view angles
- multiple relative poses between UGV and UAV
- saved images and labels in `datasets/`

Wrapper:

```bash
./run.sh capture_dataset warehouse
```

Current capture-topic baseline:

- image topic default is `/<uav>/camera0/image_raw`
- camera info default is `/<uav>/camera0/camera_info`
- camera pose default is `/<uav>/camera0/actual/center_pose`
- target pose default is `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom`, not raw `/platform/odom`
- older legacy `/<uav>/debug_camera_pose` is not published unless the simulator is started with legacy debug topics enabled

Important:

- dataset capture must use the AMCL-derived UGV pose topic for target geometry
- older captures made against raw `/platform/odom` should be treated as mislabelled for training

Examples:

```bash
./run.sh capture_dataset warehouse class:=car
./run.sh capture_dataset warehouse hz:=1.0
./run.sh capture_dataset warehouse out:=datasets/warehouse_auto_v2
```

If you want to keep dataset campaigns separate:

```bash
./run.sh capture_dataset warehouse out:=datasets/warehouse_run2
```

## Run The Sim With A YOLO Model

Start the normal sim first:

```bash
./run.sh gazebo_sim warehouse
./run.sh spawn_uav warehouse
./run.sh localization warehouse
./run.sh nav2
```

Then start the YOLO follow flow:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse
```

Tracker variant:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse tracker:=true
```

Tracker variant with explicit config:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse tracker:=true tracker_config:=botsort.yaml
```

Live follow control works here too:

```bash
./run.sh follow_control
```

Runtime command logger:

```bash
./run.sh uav_command_logger
```

This is now the preferred live logger for follow/camera behavior. It prints the actual published UAV body commands, camera pan/tilt deltas, speed, and direction labels, and logs under `debug_logs/uav_commands/`.
This keeps the current estimate-follow path untouched and additionally publishes a structured test command on `/coord/leader_visual_control`.
The estimator also publishes the clean controller-facing selected target on `/coord/leader_selected_target`.
The Step 3 trust/smoothing layer republishes the controller input on `/coord/leader_selected_target_filtered`.
The Sensors-inspired estimator-upgrade stage publishes the camera-relative control state on `/coord/leader_visual_target_estimate`.
Readable controller status is mirrored on `/coord/leader_visual_control_status`.
The visual test controller:

- prefers `/coord/leader_visual_target_estimate` as the controller-facing input
- keeps `/coord/leader_selected_target_filtered` for debug/fallback only
- consumes a camera-relative relative-state estimate built from projected range when valid, otherwise area-derived pseudo-range
- does not command the UAV directly

Planner-enabled visual-follow ownership:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true
```

When `start_visual_follow_planner:=true` together with `start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true`:

- the filtered-target + visual-target-estimator + follow-point pipeline starts automatically
- the planner stage starts automatically on top of that follow-point pipeline
- the old `follow_uav` / `follow_uav_odom` motion owner is disabled
- `visual_actuation_bridge` becomes the active motion owner
- `camera_tracker` may still use an odom-frame UGV pose to re-aim the camera when the estimator is unavailable; this is camera-only reacquisition support for sim/testing and does not make the bridge chase truth pose
- `follow_point_generator` publishes a world-frame spatial goal on `/coord/leader_follow_point`
- `follow_point_generator` now prefers `/coord/leader_estimate` XY and yaw as the primary behind-target anchor, so the UAV shadows the UGV pose instead of circling the camera-relative target projection
- `follow_point_planner` publishes a planned world-frame pose target on `/coord/leader_planned_target`
- the bridge consumes that planned target as the active upstream motion objective
- the bridge converts the planned target into the existing pose-like ENU command interface on `/<uav>/psdk_ros2/flight_control_setpoint_ENUposition_yaw`
- the bridge also mirrors `/<uav>/pose_cmd` for existing camera/debug consumers

Direct reactive controller mode remains available:

- `start_visual_follow_controller:=true` without `start_visual_follow_point_generator:=true`
- in that mode the bridge consumes `/coord/leader_visual_control` directly

Direct follow-point mode remains available:

- `start_visual_follow_point_generator:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true`
- in that mode the bridge consumes `/coord/leader_follow_point` directly without the planner stage

Current planner validation note:

- the stable `use_estimate:=false` bridge path is now the recommended tuning baseline
- recent tuned proof runs improved closed-loop stability and reduced forward overshoot in that mode
- recent stable-mode projected-range proof runs entered `range_src=ground` and produced finite upgraded range estimates
- direct `range <-> area` flapping was not observed in the projected-range proof bag
- projected-range behavior is still not fully characterized for harder estimate-driven runs, so keep that distinction clear
- the current estimator-backed phase is also validated in that same stable mode:
  - `visual_target_estimator` stayed alive in the active control path
  - `visual_follow_controller` spent most of the run in `distance_mode=estimate`
  - fallback to the old direct filtered-target path remained rare
  - bridge-enabled motion stayed bounded and recoverable
- the current planner phase is also minimally validated in that same stable mode:
  - `follow_point_generator` stayed active upstream
  - `follow_point_planner` stayed active
  - bridge status reported `active_input=planned_target` in the meaningful motion portion of the proof run
  - `/coord/leader_planned_target` and `/<uav>/pose_cmd` were published consistently
  - raw follow points moved in larger jumps while the planner clamped planned-target jumps to a smaller bounded step
  - UAV motion stayed bounded while the bridge followed the planned spatial goal

Useful checks:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_selected_target
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_selected_target_filtered_status
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_selected_target_filtered
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_visual_target_estimate_status
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_visual_target_estimate
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_follow_point_status
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_follow_point
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_planned_target_status
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_planned_target
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_visual_control_status
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_visual_control
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_visual_actuation_bridge_status
ros2 topic echo /dji0/psdk_ros2/flight_control_setpoint_ENUposition_yaw
ros2 topic echo /dji0/pose_cmd
```

Current stable proof command for the planner phase:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true record:=true record_profile:=step2_light record_tag:=planner_phase delay_s:=12
```

Harder estimate-driven planner probe:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=true use_actual_heading:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true record:=true record_profile:=step2_light record_tag:=planner_estimate_fix delay_s:=12
```

What that harder probe currently means:

- the planner no longer holds stale planned targets forever; short-loss `HOLD` now times out cleanly into `INVALID`
- in this harder mode, the main remaining weakness is upstream perception/estimate availability rather than planner ownership
- recent proof stats showed detector `NO_DET` dominating, with filtered target / visual-target estimate mostly `INVALID`
- so the planner path itself is behaving more honestly now, but the less-assisted visual regime still needs runtime hardening

Current harder-case hardening proof:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt use_estimate:=true use_actual_heading:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true record:=true record_profile:=step2_light record_tag:=robustness_hardening3 delay_s:=12
```

What changed in that hardening pass:

- `selected_target_filter` now allows bounded low-confidence reacquire from very recent plausible history instead of always dropping to invalid on those weak returns
- `camera_tracker` now keeps the last trackable leader pose alive briefly so camera pan does not freeze instantly on short estimator dropouts
- the tuned defaults now give the filter/estimator slightly longer short-gap prediction windows

What that harder proof showed relative to the earlier `planner_estimate_fix` bag:

- filtered target `VALID`: `64 -> 92`
- visual-target estimate `MEASURED+PREDICTED`: `73 -> 110`
- follow-point `ACTIVE+HOLD`: `91 -> 130`
- planner `ACTIVE+HOLD`: `126 -> 167`
- bridge `ACTIVE`: `123 -> 167`
- bridge `active_input=planned_target`: `143 -> 180`
- bridge `active_input=control`: `378 -> 193`

What that means:

- the current visual stack now survives short ugly segments better in the harder estimate-driven mode
- the planner-backed path stays active materially longer before falling back to stale-control hold
- the remaining weakness is now more clearly real visibility / geometry loss in close-range or under-UAV scenes, not a stale planner hold bug or immediate short-loss collapse

Latest shadow-follow hardening proof:

```bash
./run.sh tmux_1to1 warehouse gui:=true mode:=yolo tracker:=true obb:=true weights:=warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt camera:=detached use_estimate:=true use_actual_heading:=false start_visual_follow_planner:=true start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true record:=true record_profile:=step2_light record_tag:=shadow_follow_fix3 delay_s:=12
```

What changed in that shadow-follow pass:

- `follow_point_generator` now keeps a recent behind-target heading briefly when motion weakens, instead of relying only on the UAV-to-target view line
- `follow_point_generator` also prefers the estimator's world-frame target pose and yaw as the primary behind-target anchor in the stable planner-backed path
- follow-point, planner, and bridge progression are all more conservative so the UAV shadows more slowly
- bridge `input_mode=auto` is now safe:
  - it uses `planned_target`, then `follow_point`
  - otherwise it holds
  - it no longer falls back silently to raw controller commands

What that proof showed:

- bridge `active_input=control`: `193 -> 0`
- bridge `active_input=planned_target`: `180 -> 126`
- bridge mean `step_xy_m`: `0.1097 -> 0.0649`
- UAV XY path length over the proof window: `41.26 m -> 15.11 m`

What that means:

- the hard no-odom-style path is still not finished, because visibility / close-range geometry loss still exists upstream
- but the planner-backed path now degrades much more safely instead of flying off on a lower-level fallback when the visual chain weakens

Current stable behind-target note:

- the stable `use_estimate:=false` planner-backed path now prefers the estimated UGV world pose as the follow-point anchor
- when that anchor is fresh, `/coord/leader_follow_point_status` reports `policy_mode=target_pose_heading`
- planner and bridge still stay on the same planned-target pipeline above it
- if the upstream target estimate drops out, the follow-point stage can still go through short `HOLD` / `INVALID`, so the remaining problem is still upstream availability rather than the behind-target policy itself

Stable planner-backed path recovery:

- after the shadow-follow safety hardening, the stable `use_estimate:=false` path briefly regressed because:
  - `uav_simulator` could starve `/<uav>/pose` while detached-camera pose-service futures stayed pending
  - `leader_estimator` was treating detections as stale based on source-frame stamp rather than receive freshness
- both were fixed:
  - `uav_simulator` now keeps publishing `/<uav>/pose` and clears stuck detached-camera pose futures after a short timeout
  - `leader_estimator` now gates detection freshness on receive time while still reporting source latency
- with those fixes, the stable planner command again produces active:
  - selected-target / estimate flow
  - follow-point generation
  - planner output
  - bridge output
  - visible UAV motion

Runtime turn analysis:

```bash
./run.sh follow_debug
```

This subscribes to the follow, estimator, and camera topics and prints an interpreted diagnosis such as:

- camera-only pan is moving
- UAV body yaw command is moving
- both camera and body are moving
- suspicious motion while estimator state is `NO_DET` / `REJECT`
- logs are also saved by default under `debug_logs/follow_debug/`

For YOLO mode, detailed follow-debug topics are now muted by default. Re-enable them if needed:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse publish_follow_debug_topics:=true publish_pose_cmd_topics:=true publish_camera_debug_topics:=true
```

Default `run.sh follow_control` mode is keyboard tuning for `d_target` and `z_min`. If you want the same parameter path explicitly, use:

```bash
./run.sh follow_control --mode params
```

Default behavior:

- Nav2 still drives the UGV through the current `ugv_nav2_driver` path
- the UAV/camera runtime uses `leader_estimate` rather than shared UGV pose
- estimate-mode YOLO repositions the UAV to the seeded startup pose before the first estimate arrives
- through `scripts/run_1to1_yolo.sh`, that startup pose defaults to `uav_start_x:=-7.0` and `uav_start_z:=7.0` in non-solar worlds
- the shared follow/camera fallback tilt baseline stays at `-45.0`
- held-estimate reuse is disabled by default, so rejected/missing detections now surface directly as `REJECT` / `NO_DET` instead of `*_HOLD`
- `./run.sh 1to1_yolo ...` now defaults to `obb:=true`
- with no explicit weights override, the current default weight is:
  - `obb/mymodels/warehouse-v1-yolo26n-obb.pt`
- wrapper launch defaults also force:
  - `leader_range_mode:=auto`
- truth/error and legacy debug topics are muted by default in the YOLO wrapper:
  - `leader_actual_pose_enable:=false`
  - `publish_follow_debug_topics:=false`
  - `publish_pose_cmd_topics:=false`
  - `publish_camera_debug_topics:=false`
- estimate-mode YOLO also enables shared actual heading by default unless you override it:
  - `leader_actual_heading_enable:=true`
  - use `use_actual_heading:=false` if you want motion/estimate heading behavior instead
- direct `ros2 launch lrs_halmstad run_follow.launch.py ...` does not inherit that quiet wrapper policy automatically
- **visual actuation bridge is now the default actuation path** (merged 2026-03-17):
  - `start_visual_actuation_bridge:=true` — `follow_uav` is suppressed
  - `start_visual_follow_point_generator:=true` and `start_visual_follow_planner:=true` — full planner chain active
  - full pipeline: `leader_estimator` → `selected_target_filter` → `visual_target_estimator` → `follow_point_generator` → `follow_point_planner` → `visual_actuation_bridge` → UAV
  - to fall back to the old `follow_uav` path, override: `start_visual_actuation_bridge:=false`
- bare custom weight names resolve like this:
  - `tracker:=false` -> under `models/detection/...`
  - `tracker:=true` -> under `models/obb/...`

Current live issue under investigation:

- estimate-follow is much better than before, but the close-range case is still the active problem
- when the UGV tries to pass underneath or cross the UAV path, the estimator/follow stack can still hold the wrong range or recover too slowly
- camera/body centering and target-distance recovery are the main things to watch

First topics to watch during that event:

- `/coord/leader_estimate_status`
- `/coord/leader_debug_image`
- `/<uav>/pose`
- `/<uav>/psdk_ros2/flight_control_setpoint_ENUposition_yaw`
- `/<uav>/update_pan`
- `/<uav>/update_tilt`

Truth-assisted test mode:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse use_estimate:=false
```

This keeps the YOLO estimator running, but switches the UAV/camera path back to shared UGV pose for comparison/testing.

Warehouse `car` filter:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse target:=car
```

Different YOLO weights:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse weights:=yolo26v2.pt
```

Detection-family shorthand:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse folder:=yolo26 weights:=yolo26s.pt
```

OBB-family default:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse obb:=true
```

Return to the plain detection-family default:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse obb:=false
```

OBB-family with explicit subfolder:

```bash
./run.sh 1to1_yolo warehouse obb:=true folder:=yolo26 weights:=yolo26s-obb.pt
```

Estimate error topic:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /coord/leader_estimate_error
```

This topic is muted by default in the current YOLO path. Re-enable it with `leader_actual_pose_enable:=true` if you want estimate-vs-truth diagnostics against `/<ugv>/amcl_pose_odom`.

Available YOLO models:

These can be passed to `weights:=...` as relative paths under `<workspace_root>/models`.

Detection models:

- `detection/yolo26/yolo26n.pt`
- `detection/yolo26/yolo26s.pt`
- `detection/yolo26/yolo26m.pt`

## Scan A New Map With RViz

Use this when the current world does not already have a good Nav2 map.

1. Start Gazebo:

```bash
./run.sh gazebo_sim "name_of_world"
```

2. Start SLAM:

```bash
./run.sh slam
```

To force the 2D Hokuyo instead of the current 3D lidar path:

```bash
./run.sh slam lidar:=2d
```

3. Drive the UGV:

If the Gazebo GUI drive controls work, use them.

Keyboard option:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard \
  --ros-args \
  -p stamped:=true \
  -p frame_id:=base_link \
  -r cmd_vel:=/a201_0000/cmd_vel
```

4. Start RViz:

```bash
./run.sh nav2_rviz
```

If you are mapping with the 2D lidar, start RViz the same way:

```bash
./run.sh nav2_rviz lidar:=2d
```

5. Save the map:

Example save path for `warehouse_manual`:

```bash
mkdir -p maps
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli \
  -t /a201_0000/map \
  -f maps/warehouse_manual
```

This creates:

- `maps/warehouse_manual.yaml`
- `maps/warehouse_manual.pgm`

### Pause And Resume A SLAM Session

If you do not want to scan the whole world in one sitting, you can save the live
`slam_toolbox` pose graph and continue later.

Save a checkpoint while `./run.sh slam` is running:

```bash
./run.sh slam_save_state baylands
```

This writes:

- `maps/slam_states/baylands/baylands.posegraph`
- `maps/slam_states/baylands/baylands.data`
- `maps/baylands.yaml`
- `maps/baylands.pgm`

Later, after starting Gazebo for the same world again, resume mapping from that
checkpoint:

```bash
./run.sh gazebo_sim baylands false
./run.sh slam_resume baylands
```

By default resume starts from the first node in the saved graph, which is the
right choice when the robot respawns near the same starting pose. You can also
pass extra SLAM launch args through the resume command, for example:

```bash
./run.sh slam_resume baylands sync:=false
```

The resume wrapper now starts `slam_toolbox` directly with the serialized
pose-graph configured as `map_file_name`, which avoids the stale-time restore
problems that can happen when deserializing into an already-running node after a
sim restart. If a heavy 3D lidar world still needs extra time before SLAM
starts, you can increase the built-in warmup:

```bash
./run.sh slam_resume baylands resume_warmup_s:=5.0
```
